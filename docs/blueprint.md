## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and professionalism. A career profile is about communicating these abstract concepts.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for a clean and modern feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons. Given the deep blue and light gray base, the choice was made to go for a cooler, modern highlight color.
- Clean, readable sans-serif font for body text. Serif fonts tend to feel overly traditional, whereas sans-serif feels cleaner and more suited to modern web design. Standard fonts for the web are the best option, for ease of visual consistency between devices.
- Well-structured, single-page layout for easy navigation.
- Subtle animations on scrolling or button hovers to indicate interactivity without being distracting.
- Use flat, minimalist icons for skills and contact information.
